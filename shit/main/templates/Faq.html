                            <p>
                                A Homeowners Insurance policy is a package policy that covers your home and personal property,
                                plus loss of use, personal liability, and medical payments.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Your deductible is the part of a covered loss that the insurer does not pay. Increasing your deductible amount generally reduces your premium,
                                while still protecting you from larger losses.

                            <h2>Why should I buy homeowners insurance from BetterBind?</h2>
                            <p>
                                BetterBind uses the latest technology which uses unique data sources to more accurately assess the risks to your home and property.
                                In most cases, this means we can provide a premium quote in a few seconds using just your address.
                                Your BetterBind policy will cover the full cost of replacing your home, and if we think your house represents a lower risk,
                                we'll offer you a lower premium too.

                            <h2>My BetterBind policy includes Guaranteed Replacement Cost* - what does that mean?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Many insurance companies offer coverage that is limited to the actual cash value of your home,
                                or to a dollar limit noted in the policy. This means that if your home were severely damaged or destroyed,
                                you would receive at most the current, depreciated value of your home.  If you have elected or have been provided with Guaranteed Replacement Cost on your policy,  the BetterBind homeowners policies will cover the entire cost of rebuilding or repairing your home, with no deduction for depreciation and no dollar limit.
                                <br/> 
                                <br/> 
                               <strong>* Guaranteed Replacement Cost is standard in all states except NY. It is an OPTIONAL offering in NY.</strong>

                                Yes! In the insurance industry, BetterBind is what is known as a "Insurance Agency".
                                At the risk of getting into too much detail, we rely on (extremely well funded) "Carriers" to actually pay claims. BetterBind is backed by
                                several established insurance carriers, each rated as “A-” or better by A.M. Best.
                                (A. M. Best is the global credit rating agency focused on the insurance industry for more than 100 years).

                                Yes, either that or have your mortgage company pay your policy premiums out of your escrow account.
                                BetterBind is dedicated to bringing customers excellent coverage at a low premium, using advanced technology.
                                We use automatic billing to cut down on operations costs, and we pass that savings on to our customers.
                                Also, this is nearly always easier for you as well - you don't have to think about it, or waste money on stamps.
