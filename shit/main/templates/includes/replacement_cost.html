                    To calculate a fair premium, we need an accurate estimate of the insurance value on your home. The premium in this quote of <span data-bind="currency:$quoteVm.annualPremium()"></span> is based on the home value shown here of <span id="rcElementBlurbValue" data-bind="currency:$quoteVm.replacementCost()"></span>. We think thatâ€™s an appropriate value, but if you feel the value shown is inaccurate or improper, you can change that value accordingly. The policy will be issued offering Replacement Cost on Coverage A, per form HO-3 terms and conditions, including coinsurance wording. However, if you want to have a Guaranteed Replacement Cost, you can choose that option below and Swyfft will cover the full cost of replacing your home in the event of a full loss.
